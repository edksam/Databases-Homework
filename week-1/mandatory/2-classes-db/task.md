# Class Database

## Submission

Below you will find a set of tasks for you to complete to set up a databases of students and mentors.

To submit this homework write the correct commands for each question here:

```sql


```

When you have finished all of the questions - open a pull request with your answers to the `Databases-Homework` repository.

## Task

1. Create a new database called `cyf_classes` (hint: use `createdb` in the terminal)
2. Create a new table `mentors`, for each mentor we want to save their name, how many years they lived in Glasgow, their address and their favourite programming language.

   CREATE TABLE mentors (
  id        SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name      VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  yearsinglasgow  INT NOT NULL,
  address   VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
  favlang     VARCHAR(40)

);
3. Insert 5 mentors in the `mentors` table (you can make up the data, it doesn't need to be accurate ;-)).
   INSERT INTO MENTORS(name, yearsinglasgow, address, favlang) VALUES('Ebenezer Joshua', 5, '1 Georgia Street,Glasgow', 'AF44TO');
   INSERT INTO MENTORS(name, yearsinglasgow, address, favlang) VALUES('Donald Tramp',25, '2 Georgia Nose,Glasgow', 'AE58TO');
   INSERT INTO MENTORS(name, yearsinglasgow, address, favlang) VALUES('Mayor Daniels', 19, '381 Alphonso Road,Glasgow', 'AF88TO');
   INSERT INTO MENTORS(name, yearsinglasgow, address, favlang) VALUES('John Rawlings', 47, '90 Konado Street,Glasgow', 'TY74TO');
   INSERT INTO MENTORS(name, yearsinglasgow, address, favlang) VALUES('Freddie Bo', 20, '303 Poke Your Nose,Glasgow', 'ZP99LO');
4. Create a new table `students`, for each student we want to save their name, address and if they have graduated from Code Your Future.

   CREATE TABLE students (
  id         SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  address    VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
  cyfgraduate BOOLEAN NOT NULL
);
5. Insert 10 students in the `students` table.
   INSERT INTO STUDENTS(name, address, cyfgraduate) VALUES('John Smith', '123 CHurch Street,Glasgow', TRUE);
   INSERT INTO STUDENTS(name, address, cyfgraduate) VALUES('Joe Diggie', '45 St Johns Street,Glasgow', FALSE);
     INSERT INTO STUDENTS(name, address, cyfgraduate) VALUES('Osagie Jonas', '563 Joker Street,Glasgow', TRUE);
      INSERT INTO STUDENTS(name, address, cyfgraduate) VALUES('Joyce Offei', '123 Nosey Jobs,Glasgow', TRUE);
       INSERT INTO STUDENTS(name, address, cyfgraduate) VALUES('John Jovi', '78 Obstruction Street,Glasgow', TRUE);
6. Verify that the data you created for mentors and students are correctly stored in their respective tables (hint: use a `select` SQL statement).
7. Create a new `classes` table to record the following information:
   - A class has a leading mentor
   - A class has a topic (such as Javascript, NodeJS)
   - A class is taught at a specific date and at a specific location

 CREATE TABLE classes (
  id         SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  student_id  INT references students(id),
  mentor_id   INT references mentors(id),
  topic  VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
  location    VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
  datetaught   DATE NOT NULL
);

8. Insert a few classes in the `classes` table
9.  We now want to store who among the students attends a specific class. How would you store that? Come up with a solution and insert some data if you model this as a new table.

insert into classes(student_id, mentor_id, topic, location, datetaught) values (4, 2, 'Javascript','Glasgow','20-04-20' );
10. Answer the following questions using a `select` SQL statement:
    - Retrieve all the mentors who lived more than 5 years in Glasgow
   Ans :
   select * from mentors where yearsinglasgow > 5;
 id |     name      | yearsinglasgow |          address           | favlang

    - Retrieve all the students (retrieving student ids only is fine) who attended the Javascript class (or any other class that you have in the `classes` table).
Ans : select student_id from classes where topic='Javascript';
 student_id
